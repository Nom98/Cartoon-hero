      <h2>History of Robin Hood</h2>
      <p>
        Robin Hood is a legendary heroic outlaw originally depicted in English folklore
         and subsequently featured in literature and film.
         According to legend, he was a highly skilled archer and swordsman.
         Through retellings, additions, and variations, a body of familiar characters
         associated with Robin Hood has been created.
         These include:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maid Marian</li>
          <li>The Merry Men</li>
          <li>The Sheriff of Nottingham</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        The Sheriff is often depicted as assisting Prince John in usurping the rightful
        but absent King Richard, to whom Robin Hood remains loyal.
        His partisanship of the common people and his hostility to the Sheriff of Nottingham
        are early recorded features of the legend.
        There have been numerous variations and adaptations of the story over the
        subsequent years, and the story continues to be widely represented in literature,
        film, and television.
        Robin Hood is considered one of the best known tales of English folklore.
